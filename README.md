# odin-recipes

### Overview 
This odin project assignment involves creating a simple recipes html website. 

### Lessons Learned from initial exercise
- I applied the best practices for committing repos with git
- I applied different html tags to build a simple recipes blog/website
- I learned how to publicly publish a github webpage

### Lessons Learned from autonomous styling exercise
- I learned how to apply multiple styles to multiple pages
- I learned how to use element tags to style a page. I didn't have to go through any hassle of adding classes or ID's to accomplish some simple styling
- I learned that you could center an image by putting it in a div element and centering that div element. I used the alternative of throwing in a display and margin value pairs.
